# nugget
Neural-nets using only std library in c++

The repository contains the header file for the nugget class, which allows the user to create and train basic neural netorks. The matrix header file is the second header file contained in the repo. It is the class on which the nugget class is built and handles matrix operations. The nugget.cpp is a simple test case for the nugget class using the MNIST database. Documentation for both class is included in the form of Word documents named after the classes. 

The repository also includes the MNIST data in ascii format (do not try and open the text files in notepad for the love of all that is holy). The data is separated in training data and validation data, with the arrays of 784 pixels and labels for digits 0-9 in separate files.
